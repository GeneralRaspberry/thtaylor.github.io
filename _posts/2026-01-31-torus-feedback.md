### Model description

A uniform force field is defined on a two-dimensional domain with toroidal topology.

Particles are introduced. Each particle applies a local rotational perturbation to the field with strength 
𝛼
α, where
$$
\alpha = \mathrm{rad} \cdot \mathrm{particle}^{-1} \cdot \mathrm{frame}^{-1}
$$
At each frame, the evolution of the field is determined by the sum of particle contributions.

The resulting dynamics are chaotic.

At low particle speeds, motion is dominated by local two-dimensional structures. As particle speed increases, these local structures weaken and coherent global behaviour emerges in the form of three-dimensional super-structures.

By extension, if the system were embedded on a higher-dimensional torus, further increases in speed would be expected to produce higher-dimensional coherent structures.

One particle is marked blue to demonstrate the behaviours.
